# BIP39 Tool

A tool for recovering 12-word bitcoin recovery phrases when you only have 11 words.

## Online Version

See it here: https://jmacwhyte.github.io/recovery-phrase-recovery/

## Usage

If you managed to only write down 11 words of your 12-word recovery phrase, or wrote down one word incorrectly, this tool can find the missing word for you.

Your recovery phrase should NEVER be entered into an online website such as this one--however, if you already can't access your money because you are missing a word from your phrase, perhaps you have nothing to lose and are okay with making an exception just this once. If you do recover your funds, please move them to a new wallet ASAP, and discontinue use of the recovery phrase you've entered here.

To start, check the disclaimer and enter your phrase as you have it written down. The progress window below will update you with what is happening. Sit back and be patient--it can take anywhere from 0 to 10 minutes to find your phrase (possibly much longer on a smartphone or slow computer).
