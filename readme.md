# BIP39 Tool

A tool for recovering 12-word bitcoin recovery phrases when you only have 11 words.

## Online Version




## Usage

If you managed to only write down 11 words of your 12-word recovery phrase, this tool can find the missing word for you.

Your recovery phrase should NEVER be entered into an online website such as this one--however, if you already can't access your money because you are missing a word from your phrase, you really don't have much to lose.

Enter the 11 words you have, the the order you have them, in the box and click start. The progress window below will update you with what is happening. Sit back and be patient--it can take anywhere from 0 to 10 minutes to find your phrase.
